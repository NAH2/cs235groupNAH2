Topics discussed:
--The progress of testing the classes and resolved all small issues that occurred. 
—-Which software to use to record the screen to produce a demo. We decided to use U2Any Screen Recorder Free as it produced a file in the format we required. iMovie was used to edit the files to create one mp4 file as Tyrone is familiar with this software.

Progress since last meeting:
—-Integration testing is now complete for all classes.
—-All contribution reports have been written ready to implement into our group report.


TODO (for next meeting):
—-Complete JUnit testing cases for the classes.
—-Record a demo of the two games running and showing the game selection method and the winning and drawing states.
—-Complete our Group report.
