Topics discussed:
-- The completion of connectFour class and the running of the game.
—- Discussed a variety of testing methods and decided on using JUnit testing and integration testing for all classes, as this would ensure our application is bug free. 
-- All classes required to play othello and connect four have now been completed. The group played the game connect four testing that all winning combinations are working as expected.

Progress since last meeting:
-- The redesign of the structure has been completed, with many classes now sharing methods to make implementation smoother.
—- All completed classes checked over by Thomas to ensure doxygen comments are up to standard.
—- All completed classes also checked over by Mathew to check that each team member has now followed the code conventions so that each persons code is easy to read.

TODO (for next meeting):
-- Implement integration testing throughout the classes.
—- Tyrone to search for software to record our demo in the most efficient manner. 
—- Each team member to produce a paragraph on how they contributed to the assignment.
